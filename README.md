# here is your code.
I accidentally deleted your code from last time... but dont worry, I recoded it from home. I tried to make it as close as possible to the original code.

there are some things I need you to do fist. ill list them here but you can get to them by building (clicking the green hammer icon)

since I dont have access to the robot, you have to reassign the motor IDs at [Shooter.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fedu%2Fgreenblitz%2Fpegasus%2Fsubsystems%2FShooter.java) (subsystem).

I also made [RollIntake.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fedu%2Fgreenblitz%2Fpegasus%2Fcommands%2Fshooter%2FRollIntake.java), [RollFunnel.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fedu%2Fgreenblitz%2Fpegasus%2Fcommands%2Fshooter%2FRollFunnel.java) and [RollShooter.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fedu%2Fgreenblitz%2Fpegasus%2Fcommands%2Fshooter%2FRollShooter.java)
but you need to set the motor power.

you can change the controls at [OI.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fedu%2Fgreenblitz%2Fpegasus%2FOI.java)
at `initDebugButtons()`

if you need any help, ask *Noam*, *Amir* or *Romy*

also if Dana is there explain to her about robot code.
